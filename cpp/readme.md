For now you can use :
(ill do a grammar)

i delcaree [var_name] = [expression];
eexit [expression];

[expression] = [int_literral]//[var_name]

keep in mind that for now, you can't do shit like : x = y + 2;
you can only declare a variable by an int or a reference to another var_name, and exit with an int or a reference to a var_name

file extension is .shyt, but it doesn't matter right now as the compiler will read any files that you point to, if it exists
